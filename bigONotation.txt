1.1: Constant time O(1) - the run time will always be constant, no matter the input because the person stands up and responds immediately
1.2: Linear time O(n) - the run time will be directly proprtional to the amount of people in the room

2: Constant time O(1) - the run time will always be constant, no matter the input because it only takes one value and does the same amount of work with every value

3: Polynomial time O(n^2) - because it has nested loops, which requires 2 levels of looping over an input

4: Linear time O(n) - the run time will be directly proprtional to the length of the array

5: Linear time O(n) - the run time will be directly proprtional to the length of the array

6: Polynomial time O(n^2) - because it has nested loops, which requires 2 levels of looping over an input

7: Linear time O(n) - loops up to the given num, run time will be directly proportional to the value of num

8: Logarithmic time O(log(n)) - takes in a sorted array and item as arguments, then goes through to find the index of the item by splitting the array in half

9: Constant time O(1) - doesnt matter how long the array is, the output will always take the same amount of time to return a random element in the array

10: Linear time O(n) - checks if n is a prime number, run time will depend on for loop(if it makes it to the for loop)

13.1: O(n) - proportionate to input size
13.2: O(n) - proportionate to input size
13.3: O(n) - proportionate to input size, the longer the sting, the more recursive calls required
13.4: O(n) - proportionate to input size, the higher the triangle input number, the longer it will take
13.5: O(n) - proportionate to input size
13.6: Polynomial time O(n^k) - increase in input increases the number of recursive calls to a constant power
13.7: O(n)
13.8: Polynomial time O(n^k) - increases based on size of maze
13.9: Exponential time O(2^n)
13.10: Linear time O(n)
13.11: Logarithmic time O(log(n))
